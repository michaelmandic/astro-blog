# Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to my **first blog post** on this _shiny_ new Astro site!

> **Astro** is a modern web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.  
> It lets you use components from your favorite frameworks (like React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) — but ships **zero JavaScript by default**.

## What Can You Do With Astro?

- Build static blogs and documentation sites
- Create performant marketing pages
- Combine multiple frameworks in one project
- Use **Markdown**, **MDX**, or any modern tooling

## Example index.astro file

```
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
    <title>Astro</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
